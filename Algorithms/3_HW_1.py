# When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original listâ€™s arithmetical
# mean. The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements. Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4,
# 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]

# 0(n)
